# Codex Instructions — Cyber Portfolio

## Project goal
Build a minimal, modern, multi-page cybersecurity portfolio site.
The site should be visually clean, professional, and fast.

## Tech constraints
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (via @tailwindcss/vite)
- React Router using HashRouter
- GitHub Pages deployment (base path already configured)

## Repo rules
- Do not modify build tooling unless explicitly asked
- Do not touch node_modules or dist
- Prefer editing files in src/
- Keep components small and reusable
- No inline styles unless necessary
- Use Tailwind utilities for layout and typography

## Page structure
- Home: hero + short value statement
- Projects: grid driven by data (JSON or TS object)
- About: skills + focus areas
- Contact: social links and CTA

## Design constraints
- Minimal color palette
- Plenty of whitespace
- Subtle hover and motion only
- Mobile-first
- Accessible (semantic HTML, focus states)

## Output expectations
- Modify existing files where possible
- Explain changes briefly
- Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies
